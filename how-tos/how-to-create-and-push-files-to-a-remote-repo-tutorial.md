# How to Create and Push Files to a Remote Repository

## Overview

In this how-to, youâ€™ll use the command line to create and push new files to a remote repository (GitHub.com). 

This how-to is intended for intermediate to expert users of GitHub.

## Before you begin

Before you begin this how-to, you must have:

- Git installed and configured on your local computer
- A repository created and cloned to your local computer
- A text editor downloaded on your local computer, such as VS Code or Atom

## Step-by-step guide

### Step 1 â€” Open your terminal

To run commands, open your local computer's terminal or the text editor's built-in terminal.

### Step 2 â€” Open your cloned repository

In your terminal, perform the following actions to locate and open your cloned repository.

1. Run the `pwd` command to see your current location path on your local computer.
2. Run `ls` to see a list of directories and locate your cloned repository.
3. Run `cd` followed by the name of the cloned repository to open your cloned repository.

```
>:$ cd <cloned_repo_name>
```

4. Re-run `pwd` to validate that you have opened your cloned repository.

### Step 3 â€” Check your Git configuration settings

To check your Git configuration settings on your local computer, run the `git config -l` command in your terminal. The output should list your Git username, email, and other details.

```
>:$ git config -l
credential.helper=osxkeychain
user.name=<gitusername>
user.email=<gitemail>
core.editor=vs code --wait
core.excludesfile=/Users/kaylamorales/.gitignore_global
color.ui=true
difftool.sourcetree.cmd=opendiff "$LOCAL" "$REMOTE"
difftool.sourcetree.path=
mergetool.sourcetree.cmd=/Users/<computername>/Applications/Sourcetree.app/Contents/Resources/opendiff-w.sh "$LOCAL" "$REMOTE" -ancestor "$BASE" -merge "$MERGED"
mergetool.sourcetree.trustexitcode=true
commit.template=/Users/<computername>/.stCommitMsg
filter.lfs.process=git-lfs filter-process
filter.lfs.required=true
```

### Step 4 â€” Create a new file

To **create** a new file in your cloned repository, run the touch command followed by the file name you're giving it in your terminal.

```
>:$ git touch hello_world.md
```

### Step 5 â€” Stage your file

After you create a file and make changes to it, it's time to stage it by running the `git add .` command in your terminal.

```
>:$ git add .
```

You will not see an output after running the command.

### Step 6 â€” Commit your file

To commit your file, run `git commit -m "<message>"` in your terminal. Within the quotation marks, enter a brief description of your commit.

```
>:$ git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

Afterward, you should see a similar output:

```
[main a50f2b4] Initial commit.
 1 file changed, 104 insertions(+), 31 deletions(-)
 rewrite How-to-Guides/hello_world.md (87%)
```

### Step 7 â€” Push the file to your remote repository

Now that you've committed your file, run `git push` in your terminal to publish your changes to your remote repository.
