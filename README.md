## About
My name is Kayla; I am a technical writer based in North Carolina. I have a background in technical writing, copywriting, and project management. I devote my free time to learning new technical writing tools, methodologies, and more to enhance my skills and knowledge, as I believe that there's always room for improvement. I also believe in the importance of adapting to new technical writing industry trends and techniques because to be a good technical writer, you must learn to change with the times.

To learn more about me and my work experience, I encourage you to explore my [website](https://kaylamorales.com/). Also, please feel free to reach out via my website's [Contact](https://kaylamorales.com/contact) page for questions, feedback, and more. 😊
