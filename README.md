# Welcome ðŸ‘‹
Hi, thanks for checking out my Technical Writing Portfolio repository. 

This repository contains pieces of technical documentation that I have created or am currently in the works of creating. I started this repository in January 2022, so there is not a plethora of documentation to peruse through. However, I plan to continue to develop more technical documentation to demonstrate my writing and expertise in using version control system software (Git) and GitHub. 

If you have any questions about me and my work thus far, feel free to send a message via my website's [Contact](https://kaylamorales.com/contact) page.

Thanks again for visiting!

Cheers,
Kayla
