# What You Need to Know About QR Codes

## Overview

The goal of this explanation document is to provide an understanding of QR codes by addressing the following topics:
* The definition and purpose of QR codes
* The functionality of QR codes
* The key components of QR codes
* The advantages of utilizing QR codes
* The available resources for creating QR codes

## What QR codes are

A Quick Response (QR) code is a type of 2D barcode that contains small patterned squares and dots encoded with information. QR codes are scanned with a smartphone or tablet to quickly access information such as webpages, videos, messages, calendar events, or phone numbers. They can be used and found on banners, business cards, leaflets, public posters, and more, making it easy for users to access the encoded information.

There are two types of QR codes: static and dynamic. Static QR codes are permanent and provide limited functionality, making them ideal for resumes, business cards, and temporary marketing campaigns. Once created, the encoded data in a static QR code cannot be changed, and you cannot track metrics, such as the number of scans, location of scans, or device types used to scan.

Dynamic QR codes, on the other hand, are customizable and offer more functionality. They scan and load faster, and you can track metrics such as the total number of scans, average total scans per day, and the number of unique visitors. Dynamic QR codes are ideal for businesses, such as restaurants or government agencies, as they allow for data collection and updates when necessary.

## How they work

Many smart devices, such as iPhones, Androids, and tablets, have integrated QR readers into the camera feature or offer QR reader applications to download. The integrated QR readers and applications allow you to scan QR codes to open and view the desired information. Due to their two-dimensional design, you can scan QR codes vertically, horizontally, or at any angle becasue of.

## Components of QR codes

QR codes consist of the following components that play an important role in its functionality:

1. **Quiet Zone**: This component is the blank border surrounding the QR code. The quiet zone prevents a QR reader from interpreting anything outside the code.
2. **Finder Pattern**: This component is a pattern with three dark squares at the corners of a QR code, minus the bottom-right corner. The finder patterns inform a QR reader that it is viewing a QR code.
3. **Alignment Pattern**: This component is a a smaller square at near the bottom-right corner. The alignment pattern allows you to scan a QR code in any orientation.
4. **Timing Pattern**: An L-shaped line that passes between the finder pattern. The timing pattern helps a QR reader identify the squares even if the QR code is damaged.
5. **Version Information**: This component is the top right finder pattern. The version information identifies the version of a QR code to a QR reader.
6. **Data Cells**: These components are the small squares within the QR code that contain the encoded information, such a URL, phone number, message

## Advantages of QR codes

A primary advantage of QR codes is that they provide a digital dimension to businesses. Many businesses create QR codes to:

* Help their customers access information easily and quickly.
* Promote and market their products and services, which an improve engagement and conversions.

Another advantage is that QR codes are reliable. In comparison to traditional barcodes, QR codes can function while impaired because the QR codes design has a built-in error correction; this means that when a QR code gets damaged, it will find the correct redirection.

## Where you can create QR codes

Anyone can create QR codes through an online QR code generator, such as:
