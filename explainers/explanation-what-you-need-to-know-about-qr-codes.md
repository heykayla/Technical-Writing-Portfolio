# What You Need to Know About QR Codes

## Overview

The goal of this explanation document is to provide an understanding of QR codes by addressing the following topics:
* The definition and purpose of QR codes
* The functionality of QR codes
* The key components of QR codes
* The advantages of utilizing QR codes
* The available resources for creating QR codes

## What QR codes are

A Quick Response (QR) code is a type of 2D barcode that contains small patterned squares and dots encoded with information. QR codes are scanned with a smart device to quickly access information such as webpages, videos, messages, calendar events, or phone numbers. They can be used and found on banners, business cards, leaflets, public posters, and more, making it easy for users to access the encoded information.

There are two types of QR codes: static and dynamic. Static QR codes are permanent and provide limited functionality, making them ideal for resumes, business cards, and temporary marketing campaigns. Once created, the encoded data in a static QR code cannot be changed, and you cannot track metrics, such as the number of scans, location of scans, or device types used to scan.

Dynamic QR codes, on the other hand, are customizable and offer more functionality. They scan and load faster, and you can track metrics such as the total number of scans, average total scans per day, and the number of unique visitors. Dynamic QR codes are ideal for businesses, such as restaurants or government agencies, as they allow for data collection and updates when necessary.

## How QR codes work

QR codes are scanned with smart devices, such as iPhones, Androids, and tablets, that have integrated QR readers into their camera feature or offer QR reader applications to download. These integrated readers and applications allow you to scan QR codes and view the desired information quickly. 

Due to the two-dimensional design of QR codes, you can scan them vertically, horizontally, or at any angle, making them convenient and versatile.

## Components of QR codes

QR codes consist of the following components that are essential for their functionality:

* **Quiet Zone**: The blank border surrounding the QR code prevents a QR reader from interpreting anything outside the code.
* **Finder Pattern**: A pattern with three dark squares at the corners of the QR code informs a QR reader that it is viewing a QR code.
* **Alignment Pattern**: A smaller square located near the bottom-right corner of the QR code that allows scanning of a QR code in any orientation.
* **Timing Pattern**: An L-shaped line that helps the QR reader identify the squares, even if the QR code is damaged.
* **Version Information**: Identifies the version of the QR code to the QR reader and is located at the top right finder pattern.
* **Data Cells**: Small squares within the QR code that contain encoded information, such as a URL, phone number, or message.

## Advantages of QR codes

One of the advantages of QR codes is that they provide businesses with a digital dimension that can be leveraged in a variety of ways, including:

* Providing easy and quick access to information for customers.
* Promoting and marketing their products and services, which can improve engagement and conversions.

Another advantage of QR codes is their reliability. Unlike traditional barcodes, QR codes can function even when damaged because of their built-in error correction design. This means that even if a QR code gets damaged, it can still find the correct redirection.

## Where you can create QR codes

Anyone can create QR codes through an online QR code generator, such as:
