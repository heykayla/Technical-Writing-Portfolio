# What You Need to Know About QR Codes

## Overview

This document aims to provide an understanding of QR codes, including:

* Definition and purpose
* Functionality
* Key components of QR codes
* Advantages of utilizing QR codes
* Available resources for creating QR codes

This explanation document is intended for non-specialists who are unfamiliar with QR codes.

## What they are

A Quick Response (QR) code is a type of 2D barcode that contains small patterned squares and dots encoded with data. QR codes are used on banners, business cards, leaflets, public posters, and more, making it easy for users to access the encoded information. They can be scanned with a smartphone or tablet to quickly access information such as webpages, videos, messages, calendar events, or phone numbers.

There are two types of QR codes: static and dynamic. Static QR codes are permanent and provide limited functionality, making them ideal for resumes, business cards, and temporary marketing campaigns. Once created, the encoded data in a static QR code cannot be changed, and you cannot track metrics, such as the number of scans, location of scans, or device types used to scan.

Dynamic QR codes, on the other hand, are customizable and offer more functionality. They scan and load faster, and you can track metrics such as the total number of scans, average total scans per day, and the number of unique visitors. Dynamic QR codes are ideal for businesses, such as restaurants or government agencies, as they allow for data collection and updates when necessary.

## How QR codes work

QR codes can be scanned using smart devices, such as iPhones, Androids, and tablets, which have integrated QR readers into their camera feature or offer QR reader applications to download. These integrated readers and applications allow you to scan QR codes and view the desired information quickly. Due to the two-dimensional design of QR codes can be scanned vertically, horizontally, or at any angle, making them convenient and versatile for users.

## QR codes componenets

QR codes have specific components that are essential for their functionality, including:

1. **Quiet Zone**: The blank border surrounding the QR code that prevents a QR reader from interpreting anything outside the code.
2. **Finder Pattern**: A pattern with three dark squares at the corners of the QR code that informs a QR reader that it is viewing a QR code.
3. **Alignment Pattern**: A smaller square located near the bottom-right corner of the QR code that allows scanning of a QR code in any orientation.
4. **Timing Pattern**: An L-shaped line that helps the QR reader identify the squares, even if the QR code is damaged.
5. **Version Information**: Located at the top right finder pattern, it identifies the version of the QR code to the QR reader.
6. **Data Cells**: Small squares within the QR code that contain encoded information, such as a URL, phone number, or message.

## Advantages of QR codes

One primary advantage of QR codes is that they offer a digital dimension to businesses, allowing them to leverage them in various ways, such as:

* Facilitating easy and quick access to information for customers.
* Promoting and marketing their products and services, which can improve engagement and conversions.

Another advantage of QR codes is their reliability. Unlike traditional barcodes, QR codes can function even when impaired because of their built-in error correction design. This means that even if a QR code gets damaged, it can still find the correct redirection.
