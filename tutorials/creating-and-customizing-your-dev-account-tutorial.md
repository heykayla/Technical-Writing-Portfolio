# Creating and Customizing Your DEV Account Tutorial

## Introduction

This tutorial will teach you how to create a DEV account—a free social networking platform for developers—using your GitHub account. You will also learn how to customize your DEV account by building a profile, choosing tags and people to follow, and more.

## What you will need

To complete this tutorial, you will need:

- A computer
- Internet connection
- A GitHub account
  - o DEV gives users the option to sign-up with their Apple ID, Forem, GitHub, or Twitter account. In this tutorial, we will use GitHub to create a DEV account. However, you are welcome to choose a different third-party application. The steps for creating a DEV account with a different third-party application are similar.
  - If you do not have a GitHub account, follow GitHub's [Signing up for a new GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account) instructions.

## 1. Create a DEV account

First, we'll create a DEV account by signing up with your GitHub account.

### 1.1 Go to the DEV website

Go to the [DEV](dev.to) website to create an account. On the upper corner of the homepage, click the **Create an Account** button (red box). Or you can click the other **Create an Account** button beneath the DEV Community message (blue box). Afterward, DEV will redirect you to their sign-up page.

Click **Sign-up with GitHub** as the third-party application to create a DEV account on the sign-up page.

### 1.3 Authorize DEV to access your third-party application

DEV will redirect you to a new page requesting authorization to your GitHub account. Click **Authorize practicaldev** to approve the request. By approving the request, you allow DEV to identify you by your GitHub account (email and username).

### 1.4 Accept DEV’s policies

DEV will redirect you to the main website with a welcome message. Click the checkboxes to confirm that you agree with DEV's **Code of Conduct** and **Terms and Conditions** within the message, then click **Continue** to proceed forward.

## 2. Customize your DEV account

Now that you've created a DEV account, it's time to build your profile, choose tags and people to follow, and more.

### 2.1 Choose tags to follow

DEV will ask you to choose **tags** to follow. Tags are written with the hashtag symbol (#) followed by a keyword representing a topic (e.g., #python). Choosing tags will customize your feed by showing posts that use the tag you follow. You can choose all that apply and click **Continue** to proceed forward.

### 2.2 Build your DEV profile

The **Build your profile** form will appear for you to fill out. The form will display your GitHub profile image and username that DEV pulled from your GitHub account. If you want to change your DEV username, you can click into the **Username** field and enter a new username.

Below are fields that are a part of the form (NOTE: All fields within the form are optional to populate):

- **Bio:** You can share a brief summary of your background, interests, hobbies, and more.
- **Work:** You can share what you do for work (e.g., Technical Writer at Gringotts Wizarding Bank).
- **Education:** You can share where you went to school (e.g., Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry).
- **Skills/Languages:** List any coding languages and skills you know or are familiar with (e.g., python, ruby, Git, etc.).

### 2.3 Choose people to follow

Like many social media platforms, you can select people from the DEV community to follow. Following people on DEV lets you see their latest posts on your feed, such as videos, podcasts, articles, and more.

DEV provides a list of suggested people to follow. Select anyone to follow and click Continue once you're done to proceed forward. (NOTE: Following people on DEV is optional. You can always skip this step and follow people later.)

### 2.3 Choose your email preferences and complete DEV account customization

DEV will ask if you're interested in receiving weekly newsletters or top posts emails. You can select one, both, or neither of the email preferences. For choosing your email preferences, click the checkbox to confirm your choice. Afterward, click Finish to complete customizing your DEV profile.

DEV will direct you back to the main website with a message confirming that you're a part of the DEV community.

## Conclusion

Congratulations, you have created your DEV account and customized it. You are now a part of the DEV community and can create posts, share ideas, and collaborate with other developers.
