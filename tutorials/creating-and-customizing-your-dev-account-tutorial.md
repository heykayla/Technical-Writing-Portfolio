# Creating and customizing your DEV account

## Overview

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create a DEV account, a free social networking platform for developers, with your GitHub account. Also, you’ll learn how to customize your DEV account. This tutorial is intended for beginners. 

## Before you begin
Before you begin this tutorial, you must:
- Have a computer.
- Have an Internet connection.
- Have a GitHub account.
  
    **Note:** If you do not have a GitHub account, follow GitHub's [Signing up for a new GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account) instructions.

## DEV account creation

To get started, you’ll need to create a DEV account with your GitHub account.

**Note:** DEV also allows users to sign up with their Apple ID, Forem, or Twitter account. In this tutorial, we use GitHub to create a DEV account, but you are welcome to choose a different third-party application. The steps for creating a DEV account with a different third-party application are similar.
1. Go to the DEV website at http://dev.to/. 
2. On the homepage, click the **Create an Account** button.
3. On the **Welcome to DEV Community** sign-up page, click **Sign up with GitHub**.
4. On the **Authorize DEV** page, click **Authorize practicaldev**.

    **Note:** By approving authorization, you allow DEV to identify you by your GitHub account (email and username).
   
   **Result:** DEV redirects to the DEV website.
5. In the **Welcome to the DEV Community** dialog box, to confirm that you agree with DEV’s Code of Conduct and terms and conditions, select the checkboxes and click **Continue**.
    
##  DEV account customization
After creating a DEV account, you can customize it by building your profile, choosing tags, finding people to follow, and more.

1. *Optional*: After clicking **Continue** in the **Welcome to the DEV Community** dialog box, you can select tags to follow on the **What are you interested in?** dialog box and click **Continue**.

    **Note:** Tags customize your feed by showing posts that use your following tags.
2. *Optional*: In the **Build your profile** dialog box, populate the following fields:
  - **Username:** This field displays your GitHub username that DEV pulled from your GitHub account. If you want to change the username, you can click on the field and enter a new username.
  
    **Note:** Your profile picture is also pulled from your GitHub account, which you can change.
  - **Bio:** Share a brief summary of your background, interests, hobbies, and more.
  - **Work:** Share what you do for work (e.g., Technical Writer at Gringotts Wizarding Bank).
  - **Education:** Share where you went to school (e.g., Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry).
  - **Skills/Languages:** List any coding languages or skills you know or are familiar with (e.g., python, ruby, Git, etc.).
3. *Optional*: In the **Suggested people to follow** dialog box, select people to follow from the DEV community and click **Continue**.

    **Note:** Following people on DEV lets you see their latest posts on your feed.
4. Select your email preferences and complete the DEV account customization.

    **Note:** This is to receive weekly DEV newsletters or top post announcements. You can select one, both, or none.

**Result:** DEV directs you back to the homepage with a message confirming that you're a part of the DEV community.
