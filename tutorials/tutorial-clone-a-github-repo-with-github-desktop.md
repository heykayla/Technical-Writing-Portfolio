# Clone a GitHub Repository with GitHub Desktop

## Overview

In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to clone a repository from your GitHub.com account to your local macOS computer with GitHub Desktop. This tutorial is intended for beginner users of GitHub Desktop.

## Background

There are a few concepts to review for this tutorial:
* **Git**: An open-source version control system (VCS) software that serves as a time machine because it records changes to your files and allows you to revert or recall changes you made.
* **GitHub**: A web-based platform built on Git that can host and manage files and allows you to collaborate with other users on projects.
* **Repositories**: Folders that store files and their revision history within GitHub.
* **GitHub Desktop**: An application installed on your local computer that allows you to interact with your GitHub.com account without using the command line and web browser because it provides a simple and intuitive user interface.
* **Clone Repositories**: A local copy of a repository on your computer that is created from and syncs to your GitHub.com account, allowing you to edit and create new files remotely.
