# How to Create and Customize Your DEV Account

## Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a DEV account—a free social networking platform for developers—using your GitHub account. Afterward, you will learn how to customize your DEV account, such as building profile, choosing tags to follow, and more.

## Prerequisites

To successfully complete this tutorial, you will need:

- A computer
- Internet connection
- A GitHub account
  - DEV gives users the option to sign-up with their Apple ID, Forem, GitHub, or Twitter account. Although this tutorial demonstrates creating a DEV account with your GitHub account, you are welcome to choose a different third-party application; the steps for creating a DEV account with a different third-party application are similar.

## 1. Create a DEV account

First, we'll create a DEV account using your GitHub account.

### 1.1 Go to the DEV website

Go to the [DEV](dev.to) website to create an account.

On the upper-right-hand corner of the homepage, click the **Create an Account** button. Alternatively, you can click the other **Create an Account** button on the left-hand side of the homepage beneath the _DEV Community_ message.

### 1.2 Sign-up with a GitHub

Select **Sign-up with GitHub** as the third-party application to create a DEV account.

### 1.3 Authorize DEV to access your third-party application

Next, DEV will redirect you to a different page requesting authorization to access your GitHub account. Authorizing means that you are allowing DEV to identify you by your GitHub account based on your account's email and username. Click **Authorize practicaldev** to confirm authorizing.

### 1.4 Welcome to the DEV community

Authorizing will redirect you to the DEV website. You'll be greeted with a welcome message where you will need to click the checkboxes to confirm that you agree with DEV's **Code of Conduct** and **Terms and Conditions**. After clicking the checkboxes, click **Continue** to proceed forward.

## 2. Customize your DEV account

Now that you've created a DEV account, it's time to customize it.

### 2.1 Choose tags to follow

After completing your agreement with DEV's Code of Conduct and Terms and Conditions, DEV will ask you to select tags to follow. Selecting tags that align with your interests will help customize your feed, where you'll see content that uses the tag you follow. You can choose all that apply and click **Continue** to proceed forward.

### 2.2 Customize your DEV Account

Now you can customize your DEV account. The **Build your profile** form will appear displaying your GitHub profile image and username that DEV pulled from your GitHub account. If you would like to change your DEV username, you can do so by clicking into the **Username** field and entering a new username. Below are fields that are a part of the form (**NOTE**: All fields within the form are optional to populate):

- **Bio**: You can share a brief summary of your background, interests, hobbies, and more.
- **Work**: You can share what you do for work (e.g., Technical Writer at Hogwarts).
- **Education**: You can share where you went to school (e.g., University of the World).
- **Skills/Languages**: List any coding languages and skills that you know or are familiar with (e.g., python, ruby, Git, etc.).

### 2.3 Choose people to follow

Like Twitter, Instagram, or any other social media platform, you can select people from the DEV community to follow. When you follow someone on DEV, you'll be able to see their newly published content, such as videos, Podcasts, articles, etc., on your feed.

Select anyone to follow and click **Continue** once you're done to proceed forward.

### 2.3 Choose your email preferences

Lastly, DEV will ask if you're interested in receiving emails for weekly newsletters or top posts. You can select one, both, or neither of the email prefrences. For selecting your email preferences, click the checkbox to confirm your choice. Afterward, click _Finish_ to complete customizing your DEV profile.

### 2.4 You're now a part of the DEV community

After finishing the above steps, you are directed back to the main DEV website with a message that confirms that you're officially a part of the DEV community.

## Conclusion

Congratulations, you have created your DEV account with GitHub and customized it. Since you are now a part of the DEV community, you're able to create posts and interact with fellow DEV community members.
