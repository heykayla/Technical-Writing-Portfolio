# How to Create and Customize Your DEV Account

## Introduction

DEV is a free social networking platform for developers that encourages collaboration and sharing ideas. In this tutorial, you will learn how to create and customize your DEV account.

## Prerequisites

To successfully complete this tutorial, you will need:

- A computer
- Internet connection
- An account to a third-party application
  - DEV only gives users the option to sign-up with your Apple ID, Forem, GitHub, or Twitter account. Ensure to **have an account with at least ONE of the available third-party applications**.

## 1.1 Create a DEV account

First, we'll create a DEV account using a third-party application. This tutorial will demonstrate creating a DEV account with GitHub, but you are welcome to choose a different third-party application; the DEV sign-up process and steps are the same for all the third-party applications.

### 1.1.1 Go to the DEV website

Go to the [DEV](dev.to) website to create an account.

On the upper-right-hand corner of the homepage, click the **Create an Account** button. Alternatively, you can click the other **Create an Account** button on the left-hand side of the homepage beneath the _DEV Community_ message.

### 1.1.1 Sign-up with a third-party application

Select a sign-up option of a third-party application to create a DEV account; options include signing up with your Apple ID, Forem, GitHub, or Twitter account. In this tutorial, we will use GitHub; however, you can choose a different third-party application—the process for signing-up is the same for all the third-party applications.

### 1.1.2 Authorize DEV to access your third-party application

DEV will request that you authorize it access to your GitHub account. Authorizing means that you are allowing DEV to identify you by your GitHub account based on your GitHub's email and username. Click **Authorize practicaldev** to confirm authorizing.

### 1.1.3 Welcome to the DEV community

Authorizing will redirect you to the DEV website. You'll be greeted with a welcome message where you will need to click the checkboxes to confirm that you agree with DEV's **Code of Conduct** and **Terms and Conditions**. After clicking the checkboxes, click **Continue** to proceed forward.

In this step, you successfully created a DEV account using a third-party application. The next step will cover customizing your DEV account.

Now that you've created a free DEV account, it's time to customize it.

After completing Step 1 in this tutorial, DEV will ask you to select tags to follow to customize your feed with. Select all that apply and click **Continue** on the upper-right-hand side to proceed forward.

Now you must build your profile. A form will appear with an image and username that DEV pulled from the third-party application you signed up with. If you would like to change your DEV username, you are able to do so. It will also ask for you to populate the Bio by sharing a brief introduction about yourself as well as what you do for work and what coding skills or languages you're familiar with.

Afterward, you'll be given a list of people to follow. Select any of your choice and click Continue to proceed forward.

Lastly, DEV will as you to checkmark your email preferences, such as if you want to receive weekly newsletter emails or emails about top posts from your tags that you've selected. If you would like to not receive any emails from DEV regarding the presented options, click **Finish** to complete customizing your DEV profile.

After finishing, you are directed back to the main DEV website with a message that confirms that you're officially a part of the DEV community.
