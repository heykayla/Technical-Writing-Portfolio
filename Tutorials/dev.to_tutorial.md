# How to Create and Customize Your DEV Account

## Introduction
In this tutorial, you will learn how to create and customize your DEV account. DEV is a free social networking platform for developers that encourages collaboration and sharing ideas.

## Step 1 — Create a DEV account
In this step, you will create a **free** Dev.to account. 

Go to the [DEV](dev.to) website and on the upper-right-hand corner of the homepage, click the **Create an Account** button. Alternatively, you can click the other **Create an Account** button on the left-hand side of the homepage beneath the _DEV Community_ message.

Select a sign-up option of a third-party application to create a DEV account; options include signing up with your Apple ID, Forem, GitHub, or Twitter account. In this tutorial, we will use GitHub; however, you can choose a different third-party application—the process for signing-up is the same for all the third-party applications. 

**DEV by practicaldev** will request that you authorize it access to your GitHub account. Authorizing means that you are allowing DEV to identify you by your GitHub account based on your GitHub's email and username. Click the **Authorize practicaldev** button to confirm authorizing. 

Authorizing will redirect you to the DEV website. You'll be greeted with a welcome message where you will need to click the checkboxes to confirm that you agree with DEV's **Code of Conduct** and **Terms and Conditions**. After clicking the checkboxes, click the **Continue** button to proceed forward.

In this step, you successfully created a DEV account using a third-party application. The next step will cover customizing your DEV account.

## Step 2 — Customize your DEV.to account
Now that you've created a free DEV account, it's time to customize it. 

After completing Step 1 in this tutorial, DEV will ask you to select tags to follow to customize your feed with. Select all that apply and click **Continue** on the upper-right-hand side to proceed forward.
