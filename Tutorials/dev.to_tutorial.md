# How to Create and Customize Your DEV Account

## Introduction

This tutorial will teach you how to create a DEV account—a free social networking platform for developers—using GitHub. You will also learn how to customize your DEV account by building a profile, choosing tags to follow, and more.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you will need:

- A computer
- Internet connection
- A GitHub account
- DEV gives users the option to sign-up with their Apple ID, Forem, GitHub, or Twitter account. In this tutorial, we will use GitHub to create a DEV account. However, you are welcome to choose a different third-party application. The steps for creating a DEV account with a different third-party application are similar.

## 1. Create a DEV account

First, we'll create a DEV account using your GitHub account.

### 1.1 Go to the DEV website

Go to the [DEV](dev.to) website to create an account.

On the upper-right-hand corner of the homepage, click the **Create an Account** button. Or you can click the other **Create an Account** beneath the _DEV Community_ message.

### 1.2 Sign-up with a GitHub

Select **Sign-up with GitHub** as the third-party application to create a DEV account.

### 1.3 Authorize DEV to access your third-party application

DEV will redirect you to a new page requesting authorization to your GitHub account. By approving the authorization, you allow DEV to identify you by your GitHub account.

Click **Authorize practicaldev** to confirm authorizing.

### 1.4 Welcome to the DEV community

DEV will redirect you to the main website with a welcome message. Within the message, click the checkboxes to confirm that you agree with DEV's **Code of Conduct** and **Terms and Conditions**.

After clicking the checkboxes, click **Continue** to proceed forward.

## 2. Customize your DEV account

Now that you've created a DEV account, it's time to customize your profile, choose tags to follow, and more.

### 2.1 Choose tags to follow

DEV will ask you to choose **tags** to follow. Tags are written with the hashtag symbol (#) followed by a keyword; tags represent a topic related to a post. Choosing tags will customize your feed by showing posts that use the tag you follow.

You can choose all that apply and click **Continue** to proceed forward.

### 2.2 Build your DEV profile

The **Build your profile** form will appear for you to fill out. The form will display your GitHub profile image and username that DEV pulled from your GitHub account. If you would like to change your DEV username, you can click into the **Username** field and enter a new username. Below are fields that are a part of the form (**NOTE**: All fields within the form are optional to populate):

- **Bio**: You can share a brief summary of your background, interests, hobbies, and more.
- **Work**: You can share what you do for work (e.g., Technical Writer at Hogwarts).
- **Education**: You can share where you went to school (e.g., University of the World).
- **Skills/Languages**: List any coding languages and skills you know or are familiar with (e.g., python, ruby, Git, etc.).

### 2.3 Choose people to follow

Like many social media platforms, you can select people from the DEV community to follow. Following people on DEV allows you to see their posts, such as videos, podcasts, articles, etc., on your feed.

Select anyone to follow and click **Continue** once you're done to proceed forward.

### 2.3 Choose your email preferences

DEV will ask if you're interested in receiving weekly newsletters or top posts emails. You can select one, both, or neither of the email preferences. For choosing your email preferences, click the checkbox to confirm your choice. Afterward, click _Finish_ to complete customizing your DEV profile.

### 2.4 You're now a part of the DEV community

DEV will direct you back to the main website with a message that confirms that you're a part of the DEV community.

## Conclusion

Congratulations, you are now a part of the DEV community. From this tutorial, you have created your DEV account with GitHub and customized it.
