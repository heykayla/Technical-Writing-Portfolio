# **Introduction**

This tutorial will walk you through copying a GitHub repository from the GitHub website to the GitHub Desktop application.

At the end of this tutorial, you will have the GitHub Desktop application installed and a cloned repository to the application so that you can begin to track and manage your files from your local computer.

But before we start this tutorial, there are a few concepts to quickly review:

## Git
Git is an open-source Version Control System (VCS) software that records changes to files, allowing you to revert or recall changes you made. Think of Git as a time machine for your project, where you can always go back in time to review changes you made to a file no matter how far you've altered them.

## **GitHub**

GitHub is a collaboration platform built on top of Git that enables you to host and review files, as well as manage projects. It provides an efficient method for team collaboration by allowing multiple users to contribute to a file without having to overwrite and conflict with another user’s work.

## **Repositories**

Within GitHub, there are repositories. Repositories are folders that contain and store files and their revision history. It provides another resourceful way to collaborate with other users.

## **The GitHub Desktop Application**

The GitHub Desktop application allows you to seamlessly interact with GitHub without using the command line and web browser by providing a simple and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI).

## **Cloning Repositories**

Cloning repositories creates a local copy on your computer, enabling you to edit and create new files that you can sync to your GitHub profile on the web browser via the GitHub Desktop application.

# **Prerequisites**

To successfully complete this tutorial, you will need to:

- Have a GitHub Account
  - GitHub is **free** for anyone to use. There are paid plans that provide more features, but it is **NOT** a requirement for this tutorial.
  - If you do not have a GitHub account, you will need to create one. If you do not know how to create a GitHub account, read GitHub’s [Signing up for a new GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account) article.
- Have a desktop computer or laptop to perform the actions within this tutorial.

# **Step 1 — Download the GitHub Desktop Application**

Within this step, you will download the GitHub Desktop application to your computer.

Go to the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) website and then click **Download for macOS** (red box) if you have a Mac computer or click **Windows** (blue box) if you have a Windows computer. If you encounter issues, read the [GitHub Desktop Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop) for installation instructions.

Once the download is complete, open the application on your computer to verify if the application is working.

You should now have the GitHub Desktop application downloaded on your computer.

# **Step 2 — Sign into your GitHub Account**

Next, you will need to sign into your GitHub account. The application will open showing a welcome message and the option to sign-in. Click **Sign in to GitHub.com.**

After signing into your GitHub account, go back to the GitHub Desktop application. You should now see all the repositories that are in your GitHub account.

Now that you are signed into your GitHub account in the GitHub Desktop application, you are now ready to clone a repository from your GitHub profile to your local computer through the application.

# Step 3 — Clone a Repository

Select the repository you would like to clone to your local computer through the GitHub Desktop application under **Your Repositories**.
