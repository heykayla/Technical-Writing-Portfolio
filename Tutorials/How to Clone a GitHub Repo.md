# **Introduction**

This tutorial will walk you through copying a GitHub repository from the GitHub website to the GitHub Desktop application.

At the end of this tutorial, you will have the GitHub Desktop application installed and a cloned repository to the application so that you can begin to track and manage your files from your local computer.

But before we start this tutorial, there are a few concepts to quickly review:

## **GitHub**

GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service and version control system (VCS) that stores and manages files and tracks file changes. If you’re unfamiliar with what a VCS is, it records and manages changes to a file that shares information about who made the change and what changes they made; it also enables you to recall specific versions of a file.

As a result, GitHub provides an efficient method for team collaboration by allowing multiple users to contribute to a file without having to overwrite and conflict with another user’s work. You can also review the entire change history and revert changes of files if needed.

## **Repositories**

Within GitHub, there are repositories. Repositories are like folders that contain and store files and their revision history. It provides another resourceful way to collaborate with other users.

## **The GitHub Desktop Application**

The GitHub Desktop application allows you to seamlessly interact with GitHub without using the command line and web browser by providing a simple and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI).

## **Cloning Repositories**

Cloning repositories creates a local copy on your computer, enabling you to edit and create new files that you can sync to GitHub’s

# **Perquisites**

To successfully complete this tutorial, you will need to:

- Have a GitHub Account
  - GitHub is **free** for anyone to use. There are paid plans that provide more features, but it is **NOT** a requirement for this tutorial.
  - If you do not have a GitHub account, you will need to create one. If you do not know how to create a GitHub account, read GitHub’s [Signing up for a new GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account) article.

If you encounter issues, read the [GitHub Desktop Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop) for installation instructions.

Once the download is complete, open the application on your computer to verify if the application is working.

You should now have the GitHub Desktop applicated downloaded on your computer.

# **Step 2 — Signing into your GitHub Account**

Next, you will need to sign into your GitHub account. The application will open showing a welcome message and the option to sign-in. Click “Sign in to GitHub.com.”

After signing into your GitHub account, go back to the GitHub Desktop application. You should now see all the repositories that are in your GitHub account.

Select the repository you would like to clone to the GitHub Desktop application under “Your Repositories.” Cloning repositories allow you to
