# **Introduction**

This tutorial will walk you through copying a GitHub repository from the GitHub website to the GitHub Desktop application.

At the end of this tutorial, you will have the GitHub Desktop application installed and a cloned repository to the application so that you can begin to track and manage your files from your local computer.

But before we start this tutorial, there are a few concepts to quickly review:

## Git
Git is an open-source Version Control System (VCS) software that records changes to files, allowing you to revert or recall changes you made. Think of Git as a time machine for your project, where you can always go back in time to review changes you made to a file no matter how far you've altered them.

## **GitHub**

GitHub is a collaboration platform built on top of Git that enables you to host and review files and manage projects. It provides an efficient method for team collaboration by allowing multiple users to contribute to a file without having to overwrite and conflict with another user's work.

## **Repositories**

Within GitHub, there are repositories. Repositories are folders that contain and store files and their revision history. It provides another resourceful way to collaborate with other users.

## **The GitHub Desktop Application**

The GitHub Desktop application allows you to seamlessly interact with GitHub without using the command line and web browser by providing a simple and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI).

## **Cloning Repositories**

Cloning repositories creates a local copy on your computer, enabling you to edit and create new files that you can sync to your GitHub profile on the web browser via the GitHub Desktop application.

# **Prerequisites**

To complete this tutorial, you will need to:

 - Have a GitHub Account
 - GitHub is **free** for anyone to use. GitHub does offer paid plans that provide more features, but it is **NOT** a requirement for this tutorial.
 - If you do not have a GitHub account, you will need to create one. If you do not know how to create a GitHub account, read GitHub's [Signing up for a new GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account) article.
 - Have a repository already created in your GitHub account.
	 - If you do not know how to create a repository in GitHub, read GitHub's [Create a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo) article.
 - Have a desktop computer or laptop to perform the actions within this tutorial.

# **Step 1 — Download the GitHub Desktop Application**

You will download the GitHub Desktop application to your computer within this step.

Go to the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) website and then click **Download for macOS** (red box) if you have a Mac computer or click **Windows** (blue box) if you have a Windows computer. For installation instructions, read the [GitHub Desktop Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop) if you encounter issues.

Once the download is complete, open the application on your computer to verify if the application is working.

You should now have the GitHub Desktop application downloaded on your computer.

# **Step 2 — Sign in to your GitHub Account**

Next, you will need to sign in to your GitHub account. You should be greeted with the **Welcome to GitHub Desktop** message showcasing options to:

 - Create a free GitHub account (if you did not do so already)
 - Sign in to your GitHub account
 - Sign in to your GitHub enterprise account
 - Skip signing in or creating a GitHub account

In this tutorial, you will click the blue **Sign in to GitHub.com** button to redirect you to your web browser to sign in.

Now that you signed in to your GitHub account in the GitHub Desktop application, you are now ready to clone a repository from your GitHub profile to your local computer through the application.

# Step 3 — Clone a Repository

After signing into your GitHub account, go back to the GitHub Desktop application. You should see a **Let's Get Started** message on the application sharing the following options to choose from:

 - Creating a repository
 - Cloning a repository from the internet
 - Creating a new repository from your hard drive
 - Adding an existing repository from your hard drive

 However, you should see a list of all repositories under **Your Repositories** in your GitHub account adjacent to the GitHub Desktop options to choose from. From that list, click the repository you would like to clone to your local computer and then click the blue **Clone [Repository's Name]** button that appears at the bottom of the GitHub Desktop screen.

A pop-up window titled **Clone a Repository** will appear that defaults to cloning your repository via a URL (**NOTE:** Do not change the method for cloning your repository). Within that window, you will need to:

 1. Choose the location of where you want the repository to be cloned to in your computer under **Local Path** by clicking **Choose.**  
 2. A pop-up window will appear that displays all of your directories within your computer; find the one you want and click **Select** on the pop-up window.

 After selecting your repository's Local Path, you are directed back to the Clone a Repository pop-up window. Click the blue **Clone** button to clone your repository to your local computer.
